# Bayesian Allocation Model: The Experiments

This repository contains the source code and the data for the experiments in the article Bayesian Allocation Model: Marginal Likelihood-based Model Selection for Count Tensors by Yıldırım et al. 2020, under review for IEEE Journal on Selected Topics in Signal Processing.

The experiments are grouped under two parts due to differing software requirements: 
- *Part 1* includes the experiments up to (and excluding) particle MCMC model selection experiments. 
- *Part 2* includes the experiments on model selection with particle MCMC.

The source code and the data for the two parts can be found under their respective folders: experiments\_part\_1/ and experiments\_part\_2/. 

Please refer to the individual readme files under these folders for further instuctions.
