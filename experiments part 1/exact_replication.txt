This file is a continuation of the readme file for the Part 1 of experiments. This file describes the exact numerical replications of the experiments.

For the exact numerical replications of the experiments, some additional effort is required. Since many experiments were conducted for the paper, they were separated into different runs. For exact replications, the replicating experiments should also follow the same separations (since otherwise the different seed settings would produce different, albeit very similar results). The original result files will provide the blueprint for this. The three steps for this include 1- experiment replication, 2- result consolidation, 3- plotting (optional).

1- All result files that have been used in the paper can be found in the folder results with endings "_original". Looking at the folder results/icews_0.95_data_cp_original/ as an example, which include the comparison of SMC vs VB under the CP model at X_0.95, we can see that for experiments with a = 1.0, two separate files exist:

exp_a_1.0_N_17730_EPOCHS_100_f_0_Rs_2:17.json
exp_a_1.0_N_17730_EPOCHS_100_f_0_Rs_18:25.json

implying that the original experiments were completed in two runs, with Rs=2:17 and Rs=18:25 conducted separately. The replication attempt must also conduct the experiments in two different runs using same Rs, as well as the same number of particles (N=17730 as can be read from file name).

In order to make replication easier, we kept the original experiment files for the CP and TD experiments under the name icews_experiments_original_cp.jl and icews_experiments_original_td.jl, which are the same with the icews_experiments.jl file, but the experiment settings are fixed to the settings in the paper. So to replicate the above experiments the user must run

julia --depwarn=no icews_experiments_original_cp.jl 1.0 17730 100 2 17
julia --depwarn=no icews_experiments_original_cp.jl 1.0 17730 100 18 25

Other results can be replicated in a similar manner by examining the original result folders to see how the experiments were broken up into different results. (In order to avoiv overwriting the original results, the two files are set to write the results under the folder names ending with ..._cp and ..._td instead of ..._cp_original and ..._td_original).

2- Now that we have the results, but in separate files, we have to consolidate them into a single file so that they are plottable and are easier to examine in general. You can use the file called icews_consolidate.jl for this task. Continuing on the example above, if we wanted to consolidate the experiments with a=1.0 and N=17730 above, in the folder results/icews_0.95_data_cp_original/, the correct syntax for the file is:

julia icews_consolidate.jl icews_0.95_data_cp_original 1.0 17740

This creates a new file under the folder results/consolidated/icews_0.95_data_cp_original/ called exp_a_1.0_N_17730_EPOCHS_100_f_0_Rs_2:25.json. See the consolidated versions of the original experiments under the results/consolidated folder to better understand the process. In a single experiment set with a's and N's same and R's different, R's must follow each other without gap or overlap for this consolidation to work. For example, the two part experiments above share the same a and N, and the R's perfectly follow each other with one being 2:17, the other 18:25.

To provide further illustration, we provided the commands for the consolidation of all original experiments (in the main paper and the supplement) in a bash script called consolidate.sh. You can edit and use the script for similar operations.

3- The resulting consolidated files can be plotted by using the icews_visualize.jl file as describe in the main readme file. The plots for the original results can be found in the img/consolidated/ folder (created with ).
